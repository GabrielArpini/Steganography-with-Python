Not much chance
Completely cut loose from purpose
He was a young man riding
A bus through North Carolina
On the way to somewhere and it began to snow
And the bus stopped at a
Little cafe in the hills
And the passengers entered
And he sat at the counter with
The others and he ordered the food arrived
And the meal was particularly good
And the coffee
The waitress was unlike the women he'd known
She was unaffected
And there was a natural humor
Which came from her
And the fry cook said crazy things and the
Dishwasher in back laughed a good, clean
Pleasant laugh and the young man watched the
Snow through the window
And he wanted to stay in that cafe forever
The curious feeling swam through him
That everything was beautiful there
And it would always stay beautiful there
And then the bus driver told the passengers
That it was time to board
And the young man thought
I'll just stay here, I'll just stay here
But then he rose and he followed
The others into the bus
He found his seat and he looked
At the cafe through window
Then the bus moved off, down a curve
Downward, out of the hills
The young man looked straight forward
And he heard the other passengers
Speaking of other things
Or they were reading or trying to sleep
And they hadn't noticed the magic
And the young man put his head
To one side, closed his eyes
And pretended to sleep
There was nothing else to do-
Just to listen to the sound of the engine
And the sound of the tires in the snow
